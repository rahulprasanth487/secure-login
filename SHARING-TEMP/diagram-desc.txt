Inputs:
UPI ID
Transaction amount

1. User Interface (Input Stage)
- The user accesses the application in Guest Mode on their mobile device.
- The interface prompts the user to:
    • Enter their UPI ID (Unified Payments Interface identifier).
    • Enter the transaction amount they wish to send.
- Once both fields are filled, the details are sent to the Authorization module for verification.

2. Authorization Stage (Multi-Factor Verification)
- The Authorization module initiates a layered security process using multiple verification factors:

    a. Face Scanner (Biometric Verification)
        • The system activates the device camera to scan the user's face.
        • It generates a facial hash (a unique digital representation of the face).
        • The facial hash is compared with the hash already stored for the provided UPI ID and that will be updated on each transaction if it is happening in own device.
        • A match score is calculated based on the similarity.

    b. Location Verification (Geolocation Check)
        • The system captures the user's current location using device GPS.
        • The location is converted into a hashed value for privacy.
        • This hash is compared with hashes of previous transaction locations for the same UPI ID.
        • A location match score is generated.

3. Match Score Evaluation (Decision Point)
- The system evaluates the match scores from both face and location checks.
- Three possible outcomes:
    • If the combined (or individual) match score is above a secure threshold:
        - Authorization is successful.
        - The transaction proceeds to the Money Transfer stage.
    • If the score is below a minimum threshold:
        - The payment is immediately rejected for security reasons.
    • If the score falls within an intermediate range (not clearly pass or fail):
        - The system triggers a secondary verification step for added security.

4. Secondary Verification (Triggered by Intermediate Score)
- The user is prompted to verify their debit card number linked to the UPI ID.
    • If the debit card number is verified successfully:
        - The user is asked to scan the physical debit card for confirmation.
        - If the scan is successful, the transaction proceeds.
    • If the debit card verification fails:
        - The system moves to an optional fallback verification step or payment can be rejected.

5. Optional Block: Typing Rhythm Verification (Behavioral Biometrics)
- As a last resort, the user is asked to type a specific sentence (similar to a CAPTCHA).
- The system analyzes:
    • Typing speed (how fast the user types).
    • Dwell time (how long each key is pressed).
    • Flight time (interval between key presses).
- If the typing rhythm matches the user's historical pattern or meets security criteria:
    • The transaction proceeds.
- If the typing rhythm cannot be verified:
    • The payment is rejected.

6. Withdrawal Request Flow (Post-Transaction)
- Once the money is transferred, the recipient receives a withdrawal request.
- The recipient must approve the withdrawal within 24 hours to complete the process.
    • If approved within the time window:
        - The money is withdrawn and the transaction is finalized.
    • If not approved or rejected:
        - The withdrawal request is canceled.
